Weather action file:
Consists of weather_query_action class containing get data, parse data, substitute data, get location and perform action methods
Responsible for getting data related to weather queries, use additional methods for validation, forming sentences, substituting into sentence templates

Basic level implementation to facilitate further demonstration of subsequent modules
